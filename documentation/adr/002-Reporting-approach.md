# ADR-002: Reporting approach

## Overview

Reporting Approach - How to report, send reports and alert to slack

* Date: 2021/11/12
* Status: Decided
* Deciders: The full DoS Integration team

## Context

The dos integration project needs a reporting solution to inform DoS Leads and other stakeholders about the comparison of data between DoS and NHS UK.

High level requirements:

* The ability to create reports
* Reports can be send via email to pre-decided list of email addresses
* When reports are generated a notification is sent and received in Slack
* Multiple people in the team can create/edit reports (Not limited to point of failure)


### Detailed analysis of the options

#### Option 1 - Splunk Reporting, Emailing and Alerting

This option is use Cloud Splunk as a platform for reporting. Using all their features such as generating reports, emailing reports and alerting from Splunk.

Pros:

* Splunk is a known product so won't require validation
* Anyone with permissions can create reports (devs, tests, BAs, ect)
* A all in one platform does all what we want
* Simple to write new reports
* Already have a similar solution from the DoS Team. So there is experience in the DoS Products if we require some help.
* A corporate solution which is paid for by NHS Digital. No money taken out of our budget.
* New reports can be created quickly and adhoc

Cons:

* Difficult to get access to Splunk. Slow and very restrictive permissions.
* Splunkâ€™s limited job search rate
* To generate a report the use must understand how to write Splunk queries
* Control of our reporting is in Splunk's hands
* Logs may not reach Splunk (very low possibility)


### Option 2 - Use AWS Services for Reporting, Emailing and Alerting

This option is to use a range of AWS services to store logs, report, email and alert. Such as S3, Athena, EventBridge, Lambda and SES. This isn't a definite list but some possible services that can be used to create the solution.

Pros:

* Control over infrastructure and reporting
* Use python to create whatever kinds of reports we want CSV, PDF and graphs
* 100% of logs in storage mechanism
* Keep logs for longer than two years

Cons:

* Need a pipeline to deploy reporting infrastructure
* Additional Texas permissions required to trigger reports
* A lengthy process to create a report. A developer is required to create each report and must be tested.
* Requires multiple AWS Services that must be be put into infrastructure as code. Which must be maintained.
* Reporting solution must be paid for by our team. Money taken out of our budget

## Decision

**The decision was made to go with option 1** using Splunk as our reporting platform with all its features. As it would effect delivery time least, allow most people with the ability to create and share adhoc reports.

However we are going for a fast fail approach where if Splunk as our reporting platform can't do what we required or we can't get permissions we will switch to using option 2.
